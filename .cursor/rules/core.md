# Core Rules for OPNsense Config Faker

## 1. Code Structure

- Use Python 3.10+ for all development
- Ensure all scripts are well-documented and have clear, concise comments
- Keep the codebase organized with separation of source and generated files

## 2. Development Practices

- Use virtual environments for dependency management
- Unit tests must be written for all new features
- Integration tests should verify overall functionality
- Code reviews are required for all pull requests

## 3. Ethical Considerations

- This project respects the original work of nett-media
- Users should be encouraged to refer to the upstream project for OPNsense-specific needs
- This fork focuses on network configuration data generation rather than duplicating upstream features

## 4. Deployment

- Deployments should not include generated test data
- Production versions must be tested thoroughly before release

## 5. Contributions

- Contributions should adhere to existing code style and practices
- All contributors must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
- Feature requests are encouraged but should align with project goals
