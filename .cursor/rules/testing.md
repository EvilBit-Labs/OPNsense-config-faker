# Testing Guidelines for OPNsense Config Faker

## 1. Unit Testing

- All functions must have corresponding unit tests
- Test edge cases and typical scenarios
- Use `pytest` as the testing framework

## 2. Integration Testing

- Verify that all scripts work together without errors
- Mock external dependencies where possible
- Integration tests should cover major workflows

## 3. Test Data

- Use realistic data generated by `faker`
- Ensure test data is diverse and covers edge cases

## 4. Automated Testing

- Automated tests must run successfully in CI/CD pipeline
- Build should fail if any tests do not pass

## 5. Coverage

- Aim for 100% coverage but focus on meaningful tests
- Regularly review test coverage reports to identify gaps
