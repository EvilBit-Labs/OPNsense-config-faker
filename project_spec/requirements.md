**F003** (VLAN configuration): Generate unique VLAN configurations with realistic IP ranges following RFC 1918 standards

**F004** (Interface configuration): Create network interface configurations with proper assignments and realistic naming

**F005** (DHCP server configuration): Generate DHCP server configurations with appropriate IP pools and settings

**F006** (Outbound NAT generation): Create outbound NAT rules and Port Address Translation (PAT) configurations for internal network access to external services

**F007** (Firewall rules generation): Generate firewall policies and security rules with realistic patterns

**F008** (CARP configuration): Create high availability virtual IP configurations for failover scenarios

**F009** (RADIUS user generation): Generate RADIUS user accounts with authentication details and policies

**F010** (WireGuard VPN generation): Generate WireGuard VPN server configurations with realistic server settings and client configurations

**F011** (WireGuard client generation): Create WireGuard client configurations with unique keys, IP addresses, and connection parameters

**F012** (OpenVPN generation): Generate OpenVPN server and client configurations with appropriate certificates and authentication methods

**F013** (IPSec tunnel generation): Create IPSec tunnel configurations with realistic encryption parameters and key exchange settings

**F014** (Inbound NAT generation): Generate inbound NAT mappings and port forwarding rules for external access to internal network services

**F015** (Data validation): Ensure generated configurations are internally consistent and conflict-free

### Input/Output Requirements

**F016** (Base config template): Accept base OPNsense XML configuration files as templates for generation

**F017** (Batch processing): Support generation of multiple configurations in a single operation

**F018** (Output directory management): Organize generated files in specified output directories

### Configuration Options

**F019** (VLAN count control): Allow specification of the number of VLAN configurations to generate

**F020** (Firewall numbering): Support firewall numbering to affect IP addressing schemes

**F021** (Interface counter): Allow configuration of starting OPT interface counter values

**F022** (WAN assignment): Support assignment of VLANs to different WAN connections (1-3)

**F023** (VPN count control): Allow specification of the number of VPN configurations (WireGuard, OpenVPN, IPSec) to generate

**F024** (NAT mapping count): Allow specification of the number of inbound NAT mappings to generate

**F025** (Force overwrite): Provide option to overwrite existing files without confirmation

### Data Quality Requirements

**F026** (Unique VLAN IDs): Ensure all generated VLAN IDs are unique across configurations

**F027** (IP range validation): Validate that generated IP ranges don't conflict or overlap

**F028** (Realistic descriptions): Generate realistic network descriptions using department names and patterns

**F029** (RFC compliance): Ensure all generated network configurations follow RFC 1918 standards

**F030** (Data consistency): Maintain consistency between VLAN configurations and related network components

**F031** (VPN key uniqueness): Ensure all generated VPN keys and certificates are unique and cryptographically secure

**F032** (NAT port validation): Validate that generated NAT port mappings don't conflict with existing services

**F033** (VPN IP allocation): Ensure VPN client IP addresses are properly allocated within designated ranges

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Requirements

**TR001** (Generation speed): Generate 100 VLAN configurations in under 30 seconds

**TR002** (Memory efficiency): Handle generation of up to 1000 VLAN configurations without memory issues

**TR003** (File size limits): Generated XML files should not exceed 10MB for typical configurations

**TR004** (Concurrent processing): Support concurrent generation of multiple configuration sets

### Compatibility Requirements

**TR005** (OPNsense compatibility): Generated configurations must be compatible with OPNsense 23.x and later

**TR006** (Python compatibility): Support Python 3.10+ with 3.13 recommended

**TR007** (Cross-platform): Support macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems

**TR008** (Dependency management): Use UV package manager or pip for dependency management

### Security Requirements

**TR009** (Input validation): Validate all input parameters and file paths to prevent security issues

**TR010** (Output sanitization): Sanitize generated XML content to prevent injection attacks

**TR011** (Error handling): Provide secure error handling without exposing sensitive information

**TR012** (File permissions): Maintain appropriate file permissions for generated configuration files

### Quality Assurance Requirements

**TR013** (Configuration validation): Validate generated configurations for internal consistency

**TR014** (Error reporting): Provide clear error messages and validation feedback

**TR015** (Logging): Implement appropriate logging for debugging and audit purposes

**TR016** (Testing coverage): Maintain comprehensive test coverage for all core functionality

## User Stories

**US-001**: As a network administrator, I want to generate realistic OPNsense configurations so I can test my automation tools with authentic data

**US-002**: As a security administrator, I want to create diverse network topologies so I can validate security policies across different scenarios

**US-003**: As a DevOps engineer, I want to generate configurations in batch so I can test infrastructure deployments at scale

**US-004**: As a trainer, I want to create varied network scenarios so I can provide comprehensive training environments

**US-005**: As a developer, I want to validate generated configurations so I can ensure they work correctly with OPNsense

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following core components:

- **Data Generation Engine**: Creates realistic network configuration data
- **XML Processing Module**: Handles OPNsense XML template processing and generation
- **Validation Engine**: Ensures configuration consistency and correctness
- **Output Management**: Handles file generation and organization
- **CLI Interface**: Provides command-line access to all functionality

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints

- Focus exclusively on OPNsense firewall configurations
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing generated configurations
- Follow Python best practices and modern development standards
- Use existing dependency management (UV/pip)

### Assumptions

- Users have basic understanding of OPNsense and network concepts
- Generated configurations are for testing/training purposes only
- Base configuration templates are valid OPNsense configurations
- System has appropriate permissions for file operations

## Success Criteria

- Generated configurations pass OPNsense validation
- All functional requirements are implemented and tested
- Performance requirements are met under normal operating conditions
- User stories are satisfied with appropriate user experience
- Code quality meets project standards with comprehensive testing
