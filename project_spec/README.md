# Project Specification Documents

This directory contains the complete project specification for the OPNsense Config Faker project. These documents work together to define the complete project scope, requirements, and implementation plan.

## Document Structure

### Core Specification Documents

- **[requirements.md](requirements.md)** - **Complete requirements specification**

  - Contains all functional requirements (F001-F025) and technical requirements
  - Defines system capabilities, constraints, and implementation details
  - Serves as the authoritative source for what the system must do
  - Includes document metadata for version control and change tracking

- **[tasks.md](tasks.md)** - **Implementation task checklist**

  - Breaks down requirements into actionable development tasks
  - Provides implementation context, acceptance criteria, and dependencies
  - Tracks progress through task lifecycle (not started, in progress, completed)
  - Links tasks to specific requirements and user stories

- **[user_stories.md](user_stories.md)** - **User stories and use cases**

  - Defines user-centric requirements and scenarios
  - Provides context for why features are needed
  - Helps prioritize development based on user value
  - Supports acceptance criteria and testing scenarios

## Document Relationships

- **Requirements** define WHAT the system must do
- **Tasks** define HOW to implement the requirements
- **User Stories** define WHY the requirements matter to users
- All three documents should remain synchronized and cross-referenced

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

1. Start with `requirements.md` to understand what needs to be built
2. Use `tasks.md` to track implementation progress
3. Reference `user_stories.md` to understand user needs and priorities

### For Project Managers

1. Use `user_stories.md` to understand user value and priorities
2. Track progress using `tasks.md`
3. Validate deliverables against `requirements.md`

### For Stakeholders

1. Review `user_stories.md` to understand user benefits
2. Check `requirements.md` for technical capabilities
3. Monitor progress through `tasks.md`

## Maintenance

- Update document version and last modified date when making changes
- Document specific changes in metadata section
- Ensure all documents remain synchronized
- Review cross-references when updating any document

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Check markdown formatting
just format

# Run comprehensive checks
just ci-check

# Validate requirements consistency
grep -n "F0[0-9][0-9]" requirements.md

# Check task-requirement alignment
grep -n "TASK-" tasks.md
grep -n "F0[0-9][0-9]" tasks.md
```
