# Output Directory

This directory contains generated CSV configuration files.

## Generated Files

When you run the `generate_csv.py` script, the output files will be placed here by default:

- `test-config.csv` - Default output filename
- Custom filenames as specified with the `-o` or `--output` option

## Note

This directory is included in `.gitignore` to prevent generated test data from being committed to the repository. Only this README file will be tracked by git.
