## Transition Note

- This project is migrating from Python to Rust.
- Rust is the primary implementation target for new work. Python paths are maintained temporarily for operator parity.
- Please see Rust migration tracker issues #32–#41 for progress and cross-links.
- Backward compatibility references to Python remain during the transition and will be removed post-cutover.
