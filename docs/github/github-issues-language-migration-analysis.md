## Issues That Are Language-Agnostic

### No Updates Required

The following issues are primarily focused on functional requirements and do not contain language-specific implementation details:

- **Issue #1**: [FEATURE] Firewall Rules with Realistic Patterns
- **Issue #2**: [FEATURE] DHCP Server Configurations with Realistic Scopes
- **Issue #3**: [FEATURE] Interface Configurations with Realistic Naming
- **Issue #4**: [FEATURE] NAT Rules with Port Mappings
- **Issue #5**: [FEATURE] CARP Virtual IP Configurations
- **Issue #6**: [FEATURE] RADIUS User Accounts with Authentication Details
- **Issue #7**: [FEATURE] Cross-Reference VLANs with Appropriate Interfaces
- **Issue #8**: [FEATURE] Link DHCP Scopes to Corresponding VLAN Networks
- **Issue #9**: [FEATURE] Generate Consistent Firewall Rules Based on Network Topology
- **Issue #10**: [FEATURE] Ensure Generated Configurations are Internally Consistent
- **Issue #11**: [FEATURE] Validate IP Address Assignments Don't Conflict
- **Issue #12**: [FEATURE] Check VLAN ID Uniqueness Across All Components
- **Issue #13**: [FEATURE] VPN Configuration Generation
- **Issue #25**: [FEATURE] Inbound NAT and Port Forwarding Generation
- **Issue #31**: [TASK] Repository PM bootstrap (completed)

These issues focus on:

- Functional requirements and feature descriptions
- Network configuration concepts that are language-independent
- Business logic and data requirements
- User experience and workflow requirements

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Update Infrastructure Issues First** (#21, #23, #24, #28, #29)

   - These are foundational and block other development
   - Focus on dual-language approach during transition

2. **Update Architecture Issues** (#20, #22)

   - Critical for development direction
   - Ensure alignment with Rust migration strategy

3. **Standardize CLI Examples** (#14-#18 and others)

   - Create consistent command examples
   - Use final CLI design decisions from Rust migration

### Long-term Strategy

1. **Dual-Language Period**: Maintain both Python and Rust references during migration
2. **Gradual Transition**: Update issues as Rust implementation progresses
3. **Documentation Consistency**: Ensure all updated issues reflect current implementation status
4. **User Communication**: Clearly indicate which features are available in which language

### Update Process

1. **Batch Update**: Group similar issues for efficient updating
2. **Template Approach**: Create templates for consistent language-agnostic descriptions
3. **Version Tags**: Consider using labels to indicate Python vs Rust implementation status
4. **Migration Tracking**: Update issue descriptions to reference related Rust migration issues

## Conclusion

The migration from Python to Rust requires updates to approximately 42% of the existing issues (13 out of 31). Most updates are focused on infrastructure, testing, and CLI-related issues. The functional requirements issues are largely language-agnostic and require minimal changes, primarily limited to updating command examples.

The update strategy should prioritize infrastructure and architecture issues first, as these are foundational to the migration effort and block other development work.
