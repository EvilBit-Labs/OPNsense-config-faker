## Problem Statement

A clear and concise description of what problem this feature would solve. For example:

- "I need to generate firewall rules with realistic patterns"
- "The current VLAN generation doesn't support custom IP ranges"
- "I want to export data in YAML format"

## Proposed Solution

A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

## Alternative Solutions

A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

## Use Case

Describe how this feature would be used:

- **Who**: [e.g., Network administrators, DevOps engineers, QA testers]
- **When**: [e.g., During network testing, configuration validation, load testing]
- **Why**: [e.g., To improve test coverage, reduce manual work, support new tools]

## Example Usage

```bash
# Example of how the new feature might work
python generate_csv.py --firewall-rules --count 100 --output firewall-config.csv
```

## Expected Output

```csv
# Example of what the output might look like
VLAN,IP Range,Firewall Rule,Action,Protocol,Port
1234,10.123.45.x,Allow HTTP,ACCEPT,TCP,80
1234,10.123.45.x,Allow HTTPS,ACCEPT,TCP,443
```

## Impact

- **High**: Core functionality that many users would benefit from
- **Medium**: Useful enhancement that improves user experience
- **Low**: Nice-to-have feature for specific use cases

## Implementation Considerations

Any thoughts on how this might be implemented:

- New command line arguments
- Configuration file changes
- Data model modifications
- Dependencies that might be needed
