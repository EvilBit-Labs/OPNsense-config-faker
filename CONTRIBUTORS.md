## Original Project Attribution

This project was originally inspired by and builds upon the foundational work from:

- **Original Repository**: [nett-media/opnsense-config-generator](https://github.com/nett-media/opnsense-config-generator)
- **Original Author**: Stefan Reichhard
- **Original Purpose**: Batch creation of VLANs, Interfaces, DHCP Server, CARP IP, NAT, Firewall Rules and Radius User configurations for OPNsense
- **Initial Commit**: November 20, 2023

### Original Code Components

The following functionality was derived from or inspired by the original project:

- XML generation patterns for OPNsense configuration elements
- CSV-based configuration input approach
- Network configuration data structures
- OPNsense-specific XML templating concepts

### Transformation and Enhancement

This fork has evolved the original concept by:

- **Generalizing**: From OPNsense-specific to general network configuration data generation
- **Modernizing**: Updated to use Faker library for realistic test data generation
- **Restructuring**: Organized as a proper Python package with modern tooling
- **Expanding**: Added support for various network configuration scenarios
