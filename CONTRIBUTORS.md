## Project History

This project was originally inspired by the concept of generating OPNsense firewall configurations for testing purposes. However, this is now a complete Rust rewrite with no remaining code from any previous implementation.

## Current Contributors

- **EvilBit Labs** - Complete Rust implementation and ongoing development

## Acknowledgments

We extend our gratitude to:

- **Stefan Reichhard** and the **nett-media team** for their original work ([nett-media/opnsense-config-generator](https://github.com/nett-media/opnsense-config-generator)) that inspired the concept of automated OPNsense configuration generation
- **The Rust community** for providing excellent tooling and ecosystem
- **The OPNsense community** for maintaining the firewall platform that this tool supports
- **All contributors** who have helped improve this project

_This project is a complete rewrite with its own independent implementation._
