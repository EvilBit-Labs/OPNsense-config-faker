- **Dependencies**: All components, external tooling integration

### 9. Documentation and Developer Ergonomics

- **Base Estimate**: 6-10 hours
- **Scope**: API documentation, usage examples, justfile tasks, developer guides
- **Complexity Factors**: Comprehensive coverage, maintainable examples, automation setup
- **Dependencies**: Stable API surface, working examples

## Aggregate Estimates

### Baseline Configuration (Without XSD Validation)

- **Component Total**: 90-150 hours
- **With 20% Contingency**: 108-180 hours

### Full Configuration (With XSD Validation)

- **Component Total**: 106-182 hours
- **With 20% Contingency**: 127-218 hours

## Person-Days Conversion

### Single Developer Scenario

#### Baseline Configuration

- **Minimum**: 108 hours ÷ 6 hours/day = **18 person-days**
- **Maximum**: 180 hours ÷ 6 hours/day = **30 person-days**
- **Timeline Range**: **3.6-6.0 weeks** (5 days/week)

#### Full Configuration (With XSD)

- **Minimum**: 127 hours ÷ 6 hours/day = **21 person-days**
- **Maximum**: 218 hours ÷ 6 hours/day = **36 person-days**
- **Timeline Range**: **4.2-7.2 weeks** (5 days/week)

### Two Developer Scenario

#### Baseline Configuration

- **Minimum**: 108 hours ÷ 2 developers ÷ 6 hours/day = **9 person-days each**
- **Maximum**: 180 hours ÷ 2 developers ÷ 6 hours/day = **15 person-days each**
- **Timeline Range**: **1.8-3.0 weeks** (5 days/week, parallel work)

#### Full Configuration (With XSD)

- **Minimum**: 127 hours ÷ 2 developers ÷ 6 hours/day = **11 person-days each**
- **Maximum**: 218 hours ÷ 2 developers ÷ 6 hours/day = **18 person-days each**
- **Timeline Range**: **2.2-3.6 weeks** (5 days/week, parallel work)

## Parallelization Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Parallel)

- Developer A: CLI/UX + Documentation setup
- Developer B: VLAN/IP Generator + CSV Writer

### Phase 2: Core Systems (Parallel)

- Developer A: XML Builder
- Developer B: Validation Engine

### Phase 3: Integration and Quality (Collaborative)

- Both: Concurrency/Performance tuning
- Both: Test harness and CI pipeline
- Optional: XSD validation (can be tackled by either developer)

### Phase 4: Polish and Documentation (Parallel)

- Developer A: Final documentation and examples
- Developer B: Performance optimization and final testing

## Risk Factors and Mitigation

### High-Risk Components

1. **XML Builder (24-40 hours)**: Most complex component, potential for scope creep
2. **XSD Validation (16-32 hours)**: External dependency integration challenges
3. **Concurrency/Performance (8-16 hours)**: Optimization can be time-consuming

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Early prototyping** of XML builder to validate approach
- **Incremental development** with regular integration points
- **Performance baseline** establishment early in development
- **Flexible XSD validation** as optional feature to manage scope

## Quality Gates

### Definition of Done per Component

- [ ] Unit tests with >80% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for happy path and edge cases
- [ ] Documentation with working examples
- [ ] Clippy warnings addressed (`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`)
- [ ] Performance meets TR001/TR002 requirements
- [ ] Code review completed

### Project Milestones

1. **Week 2**: CLI, generators, and CSV writer functional
2. **Week 4**: XML builder and validation engine complete
3. **Week 6**: Full integration, performance tuned, all tests passing
4. **Week 7-8**: Documentation, polish, and optional XSD validation

## Conclusion

The development effort ranges from **18-30 person-days** for a single developer (baseline) to **21-36 person-days** (with XSD validation). With two developers working in parallel, the timeline reduces to **1.8-3.6 weeks** depending on configuration complexity.

The 20% contingency buffer accounts for integration challenges, unexpected complexity, and the iterative nature of software development. The modular design allows for flexible scope management, with XSD validation serving as an optional enhancement that can be deferred if timeline pressures emerge.
