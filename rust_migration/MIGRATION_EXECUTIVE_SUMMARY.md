## Current State Assessment

### Python Implementation Strengths

- **Performance Limitations**: Single-threaded processing limits large-scale generation
- **Cross-Platform**: Platform-specific dependencies and behavior variations

---

### Rust Implementation Advantages

- **Performance**: Concurrent processing with Rayon for enterprise-scale generation
- **Ecosystem**: Rich crate ecosystem for XML, CSV, CLI, and networking

### Technical Architecture

```rust
// Core architectural components
pub mod generators; // VLAN, IP, and configuration generators
pub mod templates;
pub mod writers; // CSV and XML output engines // Configuration template system
```

### Phased Development Approach (v0.1 → v1.0)

**Phase 1: Foundation (v0.1-v0.2)** - 4 weeks

- Establish core CLI framework with clap

- Implement VLAN/IP generation with uniqueness constraints

- Develop XML generation capabilities

**Phase 2: Enhancement (v0.3-v0.4)** - 4 weeks

- Build cross-component validation engine
- Establish performance benchmarks (TR001/TR002)
- Create property-based testing framework
  **Phase 3: Compliance (v0.5)** - 3 weeks

**Phase 4: Feature Completion (v0.6-v0.7)** - 6 weeks

**Phase 5: Production (v1.0)** - 3 weeks

- Establish release automation and distribution
