# OPNsense Config Faker - Rust Migration Executive Summary & Roadmap

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Migrate OPNsense Config Faker from Python to Rust with 100% functional parity, improved performance, and strong validation, organized as GitHub milestones and issues consumable by AI agents.

**Current State**: The Python implementation generates realistic OPNsense firewall configurations with VLANs, interfaces, DHCP, NAT rules, and firewall policies. It uses Faker for realistic data generation, lxml for XML processing, and includes comprehensive model generation from XSD schemas.

**Target State**: A performant Rust implementation leveraging concurrent processing, strict type safety, comprehensive validation, and cross-platform compatibility while maintaining full functional parity with the Python version.

**Strategic Approach**: Incremental migration through 8 major milestones (v0.1 → v1.0) with quality gates enforced at each phase, ensuring continuous integration, comprehensive testing, and performance benchmarks.

## Migration Phases and Themes

### v0.1 Core CSV/CLI

- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **AI Agents**: Can parallelize XML writer and template development

### v0.3 Validation Engine

- **Focus**: uniqueness and cross-component rules, property tests

- **Focus**: Rayon concurrency, benchmarks to meet TR001/TR002

- **Focus**: choose XSD via libxml2 or pure Rust typed models

- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks

- **AI Agents**: Can evaluate both approaches in parallel branches

- **Focus**: NAT, firewall, CARP, RADIUS

- **AI Agents**: Can work on different feature sets independently

- **Focus**: WireGuard, OpenVPN, IPSec, keys, CA

- **Duration**: 3 weeks

- **AI Agents**: Can specialize in different VPN technologies

- **Focus**: docs, UX polish, cross-platform builds, release automation

- **Duration**: 2 weeks

2. **Test Coverage**: ≥80% core functionality, ≥90% where specified

3. **Performance Benchmarks**: Meet TR001/TR002 requirements where applicable

4. **Cross-Platform**: Verified builds on Linux/macOS/Windows

5. **Airgap Compatibility**: No required network access during operation

### Performance Targets

- **TR001**: Generate 1000+ VLAN configurations in \<2 seconds
- **TR002**: Process enterprise-scale configs (10K+ objects) in \<30 seconds

```toml
clap = { version = "4.4", features = ["derive", "cargo"] }
quick-xml = { version = "0.31", features = ["serialize"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
rand = "0.8"

rayon = "1.8" # To be added for v0.4
```

- RFC 1918 compliant IP range allocation

- Department-based configuration templates

- CSV intermediate format support

- Interface assignments and configurations

- RADIUS user accounts

### Technical Risks and Mitigations

1. **XML Schema Complexity**: Early validation with sample OPNsense configurations
2. **Python Parity**: Comprehensive functional equivalence testing

### Success Metrics

- **Functional Parity**: 100% feature compatibility with Python version
- **Performance**: TR001/TR002 benchmarks consistently met
- **Reliability**: Zero data corruption or invalid configuration generation
- **Usability**: User-friendly error messages for all failure scenarios

## Implementation Timeline

**Total Duration**: 16-20 weeks
**Estimated Effort**: 127-218 person-hours (with 20% contingency)
**Parallel Development**: Supports 2-4 AI agents working simultaneously
**Integration Points**: Regular merge points to prevent divergence

This roadmap provides a structured approach to migrating OPNsense Config Faker to Rust while maintaining high quality standards and enabling efficient parallel development by AI agents.
