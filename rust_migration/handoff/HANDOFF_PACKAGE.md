## XML Validation Approach Decision Matrix

| Criteria                 | DTD        | XSD (XML Schema) | RelaxNG    | Recommendation                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**          | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐           | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | DTD for simple cases, RelaxNG for complex |
| **Memory Usage**         | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐             | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | DTD most efficient, XSD heaviest          |
| **Validation Features**  | ⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | XSD most comprehensive                    |
| **Learning Curve**       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐             | ⭐⭐⭐     | DTD simplest to understand                |
| **Industry Adoption**    | ⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐       | XSD most widely used                      |
| **Rust Ecosystem**       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐           | ⭐⭐⭐     | Good support across all                   |
| **Airgap Compatibility** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | All suitable for offline use              |
| **Error Reporting**      | ⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | XSD provides most detailed errors         |

### Decision Guidelines

**Use DTD when:**

- Simple validation requirements
- Performance is critical
- Legacy system compatibility needed
- Minimal resource consumption required

**Use XSD when:**

- Complex data type validation required
- Detailed error reporting needed
- Industry standard compliance necessary
- Rich constraint validation required

**Use RelaxNG when:**

- Balance between performance and features needed
- More flexible grammar than DTD required
- Alternative to XSD complexity desired
- Schema readability is important

### Recommended Implementation Strategy

1. **Primary**: Implement all three approaches for maximum flexibility
2. **Default**: Use XSD as the default for new implementations
3. **Fallback**: Provide DTD for performance-critical scenarios
4. **Alternative**: Offer RelaxNG for specialized use cases
