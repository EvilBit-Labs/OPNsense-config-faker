## Reporting a Vulnerability

### For Security Researchers and Users

**IMPORTANT**: This is a one-person operation. Please be patient and understanding with response times.

#### How to Report

1. **DO** create a private GitHub security advisory for vulnerabilities
2. **DO NOT** post about the vulnerability in public forums or social media
3. **DO** use GitHub's security advisory feature for responsible disclosure
4. **DO** include "SECURITY VULNERABILITY" in the advisory title

#### What to Include in Your Report

Please provide as much detail as possible:

- **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What could an attacker do with this vulnerability?
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to demonstrate the issue
- **Environment**: OS, Rust version, dependencies, etc.
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands that demonstrate the issue (if safe to share)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix it
- **Timeline**: When you discovered the issue
- **Disclosure Preferences**: Your preferences for credit/acknowledgment

#### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48-72 hours (weekdays)
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolution
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available and tested

### For Contributors

If you discover a security issue while contributing:

1. **Immediately stop** any work that might exploit the vulnerability
2. **Do not commit** any code that demonstrates the issue
3. **Create** a private GitHub security advisory with details
4. **Wait** for guidance before proceeding with any related work

## Security Considerations

### What This Tool Does (and Doesn't Do)

#### Safe Operations

- **Generates test data only**: All output is fake, non-functional configuration data
- **No network access**: Tool operates entirely offline
- **No data collection**: No telemetry, logging, or data transmission
- **Read-only operations**: Only reads input files, never modifies existing configurations
- **Deterministic output**: Same inputs produce same outputs (when seeded)

#### Security Considerations

- **File system access**: Tool reads input files and writes output files
- **XML parsing**: Processes XML files which could contain malicious content
- **Memory usage**: Large configurations may consume significant memory
- **Temporary files**: May create temporary files during processing

#### What This Tool Cannot Do

- **Cannot access networks**: No internet connectivity or network scanning
- **Cannot execute code**: No code execution capabilities
- **Cannot access system resources**: No access to system files outside specified paths
- **Cannot persist data**: No database or persistent storage

### Security Best Practices

#### For Users

1. **Validate Input Files**: Only use trusted XML files as base configurations
2. **Review Output**: Inspect generated configurations before using in test environments
3. **Use Sandboxed Environments**: Run the tool in isolated test environments
4. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Large configurations may require significant memory
5. **Keep Updated**: Use the latest stable release for security fixes

#### For Developers

1. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies for security patches
2. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents information disclosure
4. **Memory Safety**: Rust's memory safety prevents common vulnerabilities
5. **No Unsafe Code**: Project avoids `unsafe` Rust code where possible

### Known Security Limitations

#### Current Limitations

- **XML Processing**: Uses `quick-xml` which may have XML-related vulnerabilities
- **File I/O**: Standard file operations with minimal validation
- **Memory Allocation**: Large configurations may cause memory exhaustion
- **Error Messages**: May reveal file paths in error messages

#### Planned Security Improvements

- [ ] Add input file validation and sanitization
- [ ] Implement memory usage limits
- [ ] Add secure random number generation options
- [ ] Improve error message sanitization
- [ ] Add configuration file integrity checks

## Security Architecture

### Rust Security Features

This project leverages Rust's security features:

- **Memory Safety**: No buffer overflows, use-after-free, or data races
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees prevent many runtime errors
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Security features without performance overhead
- **Safe Concurrency**: Thread-safe operations where applicable

### Dependency Security

#### Security Scanning

- **cargo-audit**: Regular vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- **GitHub Dependabot**: Automated security updates for dependencies
- **Manual Review**: Regular review of new dependencies

#### Dependency Policy

- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential dependencies are included
- **Well-Maintained**: Prefer actively maintained, widely-used crates
- **Security Focused**: Choose crates with good security practices
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated to latest stable versions

### Build Security

#### CI/CD Security

- **Secure Build Environment**: GitHub Actions with minimal permissions
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning in CI
- **Artifact Verification**: Verify build artifacts before release
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of any required secrets

#### Release Security

- **Signed Releases**: GPG-signed release artifacts (planned)
- **Checksum Verification**: SHA256 checksums for all releases
- **Source Verification**: Tagged releases match source code
- **Security Notes**: Security-related changes documented in release notes

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Process

1. **Detection**: Identify and confirm security issue
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Prevent further exploitation
4. **Investigation**: Determine root cause and scope
5. **Remediation**: Develop and test fix
6. **Recovery**: Deploy fix and verify resolution
7. **Post-Incident**: Document lessons learned

### Communication Plan

#### Internal Communication

- **Immediate**: Maintainer notification via email
- **Assessment**: Technical analysis and impact evaluation
- **Resolution**: Fix development and testing
- **Deployment**: Release planning and coordination

#### External Communication

- **Users**: Security advisory via GitHub security advisories and releases
- **Community**: Disclosure in project documentation
